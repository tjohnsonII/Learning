        <tr>
          <td>Python</td>
          <td>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. ... Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>Visual Basics</td>
          <td>Visual Basic is a programming language and development environment created by Microsoft. ... Visual Basic provides a graphical user interface GUI that allows the developer to drag and drop objects into the program as well as manually write program code.</td>

        <tr>
          <td>C++</td>
          <td>C++ is a high-level programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs. C++ adds object-oriented features to its predecessor, C. C++ is one of the most popular programming language for graphical applications, such as those that run in Windows and Macintosh environments.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>C#</td>
          <td>C# (pronounced "C-sharp") is an object-oriented programming language from Microsoft that aims to combine the computing power of C++ with the programming ease of Visual Basic. C# is based on C++ and contains features similar to those of Java. C# is designed to work with Microsoft's .Net platform.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>Java</td>
          <td>Java is a high-level programming language developed by Sun Microsystems. ... The Java syntax is similar to C++, but is strictly an object-oriented programming language. For example, most Java programs contain classes, which are used to define objects, and methods, which are assigned to individual classes.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>JavaScript</td>
          <td>JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>HTML</td>
          <td>The meta description is an HTML attribute that provides a brief summary of a web page. Search engines such as Google often display the meta description—typically up to 160 characters long—in search results where they can highly influence user click-through rates.</td>

        <tr>
          <td>CSS</td>
          <td>CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, or printers. CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language</td>

        <tr>
          <td>PHP</td>
          <td>PHP (recursive acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used open source general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development and can be embedded into HTML.</td>

        <tr>
          <td>jQuery</td>
          <td>jQuery is a concise and fast JavaScript library that can be used to simplify event handling, HTML document traversing, Ajax interactions and animation for speedy website development. jQuery simplifies the HTML's client-side scripting, thus simplifying Web 2.0 applications development.</td>
